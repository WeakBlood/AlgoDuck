AlgoDuck - Competitive Programming and Algorithm Resources
</title>
<META NAME="Description" CONTENT="Wanna see some algorithms ? You came to the right place. 
AlgoDuck is a project about competitive programming algorithms i'm doing on my own, why ? because i was bored, in fact 
this site does not contain any AD or Payment Program. Maybe once it becomes a quack level site then i will 
add donations, until then, enjoy this personal little mess <3 ">

<p>This site is meant to help anyone who wants to learn some simple or
more complex algorithms and with this project i also help
<strong><em>myself</em></strong> by forcing to find a good explanation
for some concepts.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>You will need decent English knowledge (like mine, which is kind
of shit) because handbooks, problem descriptions (in case you are
solving ICPC, IOI, CF, etc.), and most general resources will be
translated in English. In some contests, like IOI, the use of
translation tools is strictly prohibited, but still not knowing the
language¬† will keep you at a disadvantage.</p></li>
<li><p>Knowing basics algebra and geometry concepts.</p></li>
<li><p>Being competitive.</p></li>
<li><p>A mascotte. ( it‚Äôs mandatory for good scores in contests and for
trying out <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">RUBBER DUCK
DEBUGGING</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Last but not least, patience, you will need much, much, too much
patience, like everything else, it takes <strong><em>time</em></strong>
to grasp these concepts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For moving your first steps into the competitive programming world
you <em>will</em> need this handbook ( which i personally call:) <a
href="https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf">The Bible of Competitive
Programming</a>.</p>
<p>It contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An introduction to the cp world and basics of STL
library.</p></li>
<li><p>Almost all of the data structures you will ever need in your cp
career.</p></li>
<li><p>Greedy Techniques.</p></li>
<li><p>Graph Theory.</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamic Programming.</p></li>
<li><p>Much more ;)</p></li>
</ul>
<div style="font-size:9pt">
<blockquote>
<p>If you don‚Äôt know the meaning of some of the terms mentioned earlier,
don‚Äôt worry, i gotch u:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>STL: It‚Äôs a C++ library, C++ gives a box full of pre-coded tools
like (vectors, lists, queues, stacks, ordering algorithms and much more
), by using these tools you will save lots of time and also preserve
your mental health.</p></li>
<li><p>Greedy algorithms follow a simple logic, choose always the option
that seems better in that moment, even if that means losing a future
opportunity.</p></li>
<li><p>Graphs theory, it‚Äôs by far my favorite topic, it is not a
technique it self, but it allows you to see some problems under a
comptely different prespective. In graphs theory you will have Vertexes
which will act as cities or points you can reach, the Edges on the other
hand are simply the connections made between each Vertex. (Two cities
are two Vertexes, if from city A you can reach city B this means that
there is at least one edge between the two).</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamic programming is a perfected version of the Greedy
strategy, with some assumptions and base cases, you will be able to
<em>construct</em> a <em>perfect solution</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>For starting doing some pratice, you can sign up to and try to solve
as many problems as possible most of which will be easily solvable by
reading the early mentioned <a href="https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf">The
Bible of Competitive Programming</a>. <a
href="https://cses.fi/problemset/">CSES</a>.</p>
<div style="font-size: 13px;">
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO INSTANTLY GET TO A SOLUTION
RIGHT, KEEP PUSHING, KEEP TRYING, YOU WILL IMPROVE QUICKLY BY NOT GIVING
UP EASILY. </em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>This does not mean that you should stay on a single
problem for weeks, but at your discretion understand when you are
completely stalled an start reading some parts of the solution, if still
nothing comes to your mind then read the full solution and try as hard
as you can to understand it.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For CSES solutions i would recommend this well made repository of an
Italian OII champion, <a
href="https://github.com/lorenzo-ferrari/cses/tree/main/src">GITHUB
SOLUTION</a> do not abuse this repo. <strong><em>You got
this!</em></strong></p>

are some great platforms for competitive programming:</h4>

<li><p><a href="https://usaco.guide/">USACOGUIDE</a> ( an extremely

<li><p><a href="https://cses.fi/problemset/">CSES</a> ( problem set
mentioned above. )</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://leetcode.com/">LEETCODE</a> ( just kidding, stay
away from this, at least for the pricey useless features, remember:
<strong><em>YOU WILL NEVER HAVE TO PAY SOMEONE ON THE INTERNET FOR
GETTING THIS KIND OF KNOwLEDGE.</em></strong> )</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://codeforces.com/">CODEFORCES BLOGS</a> ( the best
of the best for any experience range competitive programmer, full of
precious blogs made by <strong><em>red coders.</em></strong> ) ( The
only drawback is that it can be really inconsistent.)</p></li>

<p>In this template:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>I am adding the library for getting lots of pre-coded algorithms out
of the box, the library it self is <em>not</em> an heavyweight
library.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>I am adding macros ‚Äú#define‚Äù that allows me to write a custom
shortcut for simplicity and speed. ( You can even create macros with
arguments ).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The namespace std; allows me to skip the syntax needed before using
any element from a library for example vector without it would be
std::vector&lt;&gt; instead of vector&lt;&gt;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In the main function, i added some lines for fast I/O and check if
the code is being compiled locally or not which is a really useful thing
for debugging.</li>
